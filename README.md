# Director
It’s Friday night. The party’s poppin’. Everything looks perfect - except Tom’s appointed himself the DJ. From every last remix of Old Town Road, to a salacious selection of death metal and mumble rap, Tom’s playlist is uniquely… his. Which is fine! But at a party, everyone should have a say in the music. Enter Director: a service to democratize party playlists, getting everyone involved in the musical extravaganza.
